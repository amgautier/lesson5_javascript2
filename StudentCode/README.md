### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. We learned the differences between global,local,limitited, and stovepipe variables. For example, a global variable is declared outside a function and available to all parts of your program.
2. We learned about named and anonymous functions. Named functions are related statements that are assigned a name. You call a named function to execute it. An anoynmous function does not have an assigned name. They work only where they are located. 
3. We learned that you are able to find and locate erros using browser controle, a very useful tool for coders.
